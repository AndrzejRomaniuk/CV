# üê≠GENERAL PROFILE
---

Self-driven and passionate about his work, I am a published PhD graduate with a background in micromammal archaeology and academic teaching (statistics and statistical programming). I hope to either continue my academic career, combining archaeology and evolutionary biology to investigate human impact on both domesticated and wild species evolution or find a place where my broad range of skills may be of use.
